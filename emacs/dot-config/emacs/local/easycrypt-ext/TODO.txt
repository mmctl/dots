- Bug: Auto-closing comment does not work when typing `*)`
- Bug: Comment might be after ending sentence with `.`, in which case current indentation thinks the sentence wasn't terminated (because line doesn't end with a `.`), and indents next line instead of aligning.
- Bug: Indentation inside actual code blocks (between `{` and `}`) should be indented
separately from other enclosures, and should be indented by tab-width 
- Maybe: In comment, have align with previous non-empty line override indent by tab width
- Maybe: have regular indent do indent rigidly, even when no region is active (currently does to tab stop)
- Fix: repeat map also triggered by undoing/deleting, not just by processing
- Fix: Call template: Spacing of field start after colon 
- Bug: Cfold template parse error
- Fix: proc template auto exit on entering last field (body)
- Bug: indentation in following case, both on second line (i.e., after newline + indent on first),  and third line (i.e., after newline + indent on second)
